This project is a hike finder that takes the amount of time the user has to drive to hike the trail, and drive back to their current destination. The way this program works is with two seperate API calls. One that pulls hikes from Open Trails and the other being Google maps API. These allow us to pull the hikes that are presented in the user's entered city. Google maps figures out how for the users distance is from the hike and calculates accordingly.",
